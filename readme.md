Android app that allows a user to create stick figure animations similar to pivot on desktop.

## Desktop port

A minimal Processing based desktop version lives in the `desktop/` folder. Use `run.sh` to compile and run it. Two entry points are available:

```
./run.sh            # runs the launch animation
./run.sh draw       # runs the draw stick figure animation demo
```

The script compiles the sources and places the generated class files in `desktop/out/` which is ignored from version control.
