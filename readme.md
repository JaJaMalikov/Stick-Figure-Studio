Android app that allows a user to create stick figure animations similar to pivot on desktop.

## Desktop version

A standalone desktop port lives in the `desktop` directory. All sources from the
mobile app have been copied here and trimmed of Android dependencies. The
desktop build also runs in **landscape** mode (1920x1080). To try it out run:

```bash
cd desktop
./run.sh
```

This will compile the desktop sources and start the launch animation.
