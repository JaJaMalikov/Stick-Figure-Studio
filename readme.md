Android app that allows a user to create stick figure animations similar to pivot on desktop.

## Desktop Demo

The `desktop/` folder contains a minimal Processing setup for running the animation without any Android dependencies. To build and run the example:

```bash
cd desktop
./run.sh
```

This requires a JDK installed on your machine. The script compiles the desktop sources along with shared classes under `app/src/main/java` and launches the `DrawStickFigureAnimDesktop` sketch.
