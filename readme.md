Android app that allows a user to create stick figure animations similar to pivot on desktop.

## Desktop version

A standalone desktop port lives in the `desktop` directory. The desktop source
tree mirrors the structure of the Android app with simplified replacements for
the activities. All sketches run in **landscape** mode (1920x1080). To try it
out run:

```bash
cd desktop
./run.sh
```
This will compile the desktop sources and start the launch animation.
After the splash screen a simple menu appears from which the stick
figure animation can be launched.
